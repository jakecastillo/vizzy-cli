## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-17

The "exposure-safety platform" release: vizzy goes from an interactive visibility
toggle to a scriptable, CI-embeddable exposure tool — deeper scanning, machine
output, new commands, and an accessible UI.

### Added

- **Scriptable / headless mode** — run without the TUI: `--repos <a,b,c | @file | ->`,
  `--all-eligible`, `--yes`, and `--allow-danger`. The exposure scan still runs;
  a repo with a detected secret is **skipped and reported** unless explicitly
  allowed. A documented exit-code contract (`0` ok · `1` danger/failure · `2`
  usage · `3` auth/network) makes vizzy CI-friendly. No-TTY without headless flags
  prints actionable guidance instead of crashing.
- **`--json` / `--format text|json|sarif`** — machine-readable `--audit` output;
  SARIF 2.1.0 uploads to GitHub Code Scanning.
- **Deeper exposure scan in `vizzy check`** — beyond filename matching, `vizzy
  check` scans **file content** (high-confidence keys: AWS, GitHub, Stripe, Slack,
  Google, PEM private keys) and **git history** (a secret deleted from HEAD but
  still recoverable → `secret-in-history`). The bulk going-public and `--audit`
  flows use the fast filename + risk-signal scan; wiring content/history into them
  (a `--deep` flag) is tracked as a follow-up.
- **`vizzy --check [owner/repo]`** — a pre-publish readiness command for one repo
  (secrets in tree + content + history, LICENSE, README/CONTRIBUTING/CODE_OF_CONDUCT,
  large files), inferring the repo from the cwd git remote.
- **`--org <name>`** — audit a GitHub org (read-only; write flags rejected).
- **Drift detection** — `--audit` records `.vizzy/state.json`; `--fail-on-new`
  exits non-zero only on NEW exposure vs the snapshot (pre-existing debt tolerated).
- **Bulk archive** — `--archive` / `--unarchive` (headless; no exposure scan).
- **`.vizzyscan`** — custom danger globs + an allowlist (allow beats deny).
- **Per-repo consequences** in the confirm screen (e.g. "erases N stars",
  "detaches forks").
- **Accessible output** — `--plain` and the `NO_COLOR` env var disable ANSI color
  and spinners.
- **Distribution artifacts** — a `gh` extension shim (`gh-extension/gh-vizzy`), a
  composite GitHub **Action** (`action.yml`) + example workflow, a staged
  npm-provenance release workflow, and a VHS demo `.tape`. (Publishing / the
  separate `gh-vizzy` repo / rendering the GIF are manual steps.)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Pre-visibility checks** before any _public_ switch — making a repo public is a
  one-way door, so vizzy now runs a read-only pre-flight and scales the
  confirmation friction to the risk:
  - **Sensitive-file scan** of each selected repo's file tree (no code downloaded)
    flags expose-risk files — `.env`, private keys, `credentials*`, `.npmrc`,
    `service-account*.json`, etc. — while ignoring conventional samples like
    `.env.example`.
  - **Per-repo risk signals**: no `LICENSE`, stale (>1y since last push),
    high-profile (many stars), or archived.
  - **Escalating typed confirmation**: clean → `y`; caution → type `public`;
    danger (a likely secret) → type the repo's **name** to arm it, else it's
    skipped and left private. A failed/truncated scan degrades to _caution_
    (scan-incomplete), never a silent all-clear.
- **`.vizzyignore`** — a glob list of repos that may never be made public
  (hidden from the public selection); `--no-protect` ignores it for a run.
- **`--audit`** — non-interactive "what have I already exposed?" report over your
  currently-public repos; exits non-zero on any danger finding (CI-friendly).
- **`--force-public`** — pre-arm danger repos so you skip per-repo name-typing
  (you still type `public` to confirm the batch).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Initial release.
- Interactive TUI (Ink) to bulk-change the visibility of your personal GitHub
  repositories.
- Target-first flow: pick Private or Public, then choose from the repos that
  aren't already in that state.
- Multi-select list: `↑/↓` move, `space` toggle, `a` select-all, `enter` confirm.
- Loud confirmation when making repositories public; `--dry-run` to preview
  without applying.
- Flags: `--private`, `--public`, `--dry-run`, `--include-archived`,
  `--no-forks`, `--help`, `--version`.
- Auth via the `gh` CLI token, with `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback.
- Concurrency-limited apply step with per-repo success/failure reporting.
